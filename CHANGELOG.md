### Added
- Terminal-first CLI with full narrow interface (create, put, get, exec, list, destroy, etc.)
- Linux prototype with namespaces + Landlock + no_new_privs sandboxing
- Disciplined C core (`l2_sys_*` interface) with memory safety guards
- Out-of-process L2P protocol support
- Full seL4/Microkit integration on-ramp with `l2 sel4-setup` and buildable example
- High-assurance documentation and C coding guidelines
- Explicit prototype warnings and production seL4 path

### Changed
- Extreme scope restraint maintained throughout
- Total cleanup and explicit authority model enforced

l2 is now ready for high-assurance use cases with seL4 as the foundation.
